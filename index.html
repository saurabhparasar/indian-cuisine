      <h1>The Indian Cuisine</h1>
      <h1 class="author">By Saurabh Parasar</h1>
      <h2>Culture Of India</h2>
      <p>
        Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional
        cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent.<br />
        Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and
        occupations, these cuisines vary substantially <br />
        and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.<br />
        Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular
        Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions.<br />
        Centuries of Islamic rule, particularly by the Mughals, also introduced
        dishes like samosa and pilaf

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism
        have played a role in introducing <br />
        certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World
        brought a number of new vegetables <br />
        and fruit to India. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes,
        chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples <br />
        in many regions of India.
